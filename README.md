## program description
In this project, we design the GUI for the snake game. GUI is the interface
 that user can interact with the program. The figures in the game that user
  can interact with are defined and stored in two grids, with each of their
   element corresponds to the position on the game board. One of the grid
    stores all the obstacles, zappers, etc, whereas the other grid represents
     the trail, which is originally transparent but can be visible if the
      user moves and leaves a path. Also the program defines how the user can
       use keyboard to interact with the game.
